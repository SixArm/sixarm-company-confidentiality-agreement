form, whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to:

secrets; and

(e) any other information that should reasonably be recognized as
confidential information of the Disclosing Party.

Confidential Information need not be novel, unique, patentable,

Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the

been developed and obtained through great efforts by the Disclosing
Party and that Disclosing Party regards all of its Confidential
Information as trade secrets.

### 2.2. Non-Confidential Information

Confidential Information shall not include information which:

(a) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receiving the

under an obligation to Disclosing Party to maintain confidentiality;

(c) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of or failure to
act by the Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement;

## 4. Content


### 4.1 Disclosure of Confidential Information

From time to time, the Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential
Information to the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party will:

(a) limit disclosure of any Confidential Information to its directors,
officers, employees, agents or representatives (collectively
“Representatives”) who have a need to know such Confidential
Information in connection with the current or contemplated business
relationship between the parties to which this Agreement relates, and
only for that purpose;

(b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the
Confidential Information and of the obligations set forth in this
Agreement and require such Representatives to keep the Confidential
Information confidential;

(c) shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential by
using a reasonable degree of care, but not less than the degree of
care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; and

(d) not disclose any Confidential Information received by it to any
third parties (except as otherwise provided for herein).

Each party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by
any of their respective Representatives.


### 4.2 Use of Confidential Information

The Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information solely
in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship
between the parties and not for any purpose other than as authorized
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of an authorized
representative of the Disclosing Party.

No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the
Confidential Information is granted to the Receiving Party
hereunder. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in
the Disclosing Party.

All use of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be
for the benefit of the Disclosing Party and any modifications and
improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be the sole property
of the Disclosing Party.

Nothing contained herein is intended to modify the parties' existing
agreement that their discussions in furtherance of a potential
business relationship are governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 408.


### 4.3 Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the
Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any
governmental, judicial, or administrative order, subpoena, discovery
request, regulatory request or similar method, provided that the
Receiving Party promptly notifies, to the extent practicable, the
Disclosing Party in writing of such demand for disclosure so that the
Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek to make such
disclosure subject to a protective order or other appropriate remedy
to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information;
provided in the case of a broad regulatory request with respect to the
Receiving Party’s business (not targeted at Disclosing Party), the
Receiving Party may promptly comply with such request provided the
Receiving Party give (if permitted by such regulator) the Disclosing
Party prompt notice of such disclosure.

The Receiving Party agrees that it shall not oppose and shall
cooperate with efforts by, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing
Party with respect to any such request for a protective order or other
relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disclosing Party is
unable to obtain or does not seek a protective order and the Receiving
Party is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential
Information, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made
without liability.


### 4.4 Return of Confidential Information

Receiving Party shall immediately return and redeliver to the other
all tangible material embodying the Confidential Information provided
hereunder and all notes, summaries, memoranda, drawings, manuals,
records, excerpts or derivative information deriving there from and
all other documents or materials (“Notes”) (and all copies of any of
the foregoing, including “copies” that have been converted to
computerized media in the form of image, data or word processing files
either manually or by image capture) based on or including any
Confidential Information, in whatever form of storage or retrieval,
upon the earlier of (i) the completion or termination of the dealings
between the parties contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of
this Agreement; or (iii) at such time as the Disclosing Party may so
request; provided however that the Receiving Party may retain such of
its documents as is necessary to enable it to comply with its document
retention policies.

Alternatively, the Receiving Party, with the written consent of the
Disclosing Party may (or in the case of Notes, at the Receiving
Party’s option) immediately destroy any of the foregoing embodying
Confidential Information (or the reasonably nonrecoverable data
erasure of computerized data) and, upon request, certify in writing
such destruction by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party
supervising the destruction).


### 4.5 Notice of Breach

Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon
discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential
Information by Receiving Party or its Representatives, or any other
breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party or its Representatives,
and will cooperate with efforts by the Disclosing Party to help the
Disclosing Party regain possession of Confidential Information and
prevent its further unauthorized use.


### 4.6 No Binding Agreement for Transaction

The parties agree that neither party will be under any legal
obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by
virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed
to herein. The parties further acknowledge and agree that they each
reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject
any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations
with respect to a Transaction at any time.

This Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between
the parties.

If a Transaction goes forward, the non-disclosure provisions of any
applicable transaction documents entered into between the parties (or
their respective affiliates) for the Transaction shall supersede this
Agreement. In the event such provision is not provided for in said
transaction documents, this Agreement shall control.


### 4.7 Competition

The receipt of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement
will not prevent or in any way limit either party from: (i)
developing, making or marketing products or services that are or may
be competitive with the products or services of the other; or (ii)
providing products or services to others who compete with the other.


### 4.8 Term

This Agreement shall remain in effect for a two-year term (subject to
a one year extension if the parties are still discussing and
considering the Transaction at the end of the second year).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties’ duty to hold in confidence
Confidential Information that was disclosed during term shall remain
in effect indefinitely.


## 5. Resolution


### 5.1. Agreement to resolve claims

We use the American Arbitration Association (AAA) standard procedures
for mediation and non-binding arbitration.


### 5.2. Mediation

If any controversy or claim arises out of or relating to this
contract, or the breach thereof, and cannot be settled through
negotiation, then the parties agree to try in good faith to settle the
dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration
Association under its mediation procedures before resorting to
arbitration, litigation or some other dispute resolution procedure.


### 5.3. Non-Binding Arbitration

If any controversy or claim arises out of or relating to this
contract, or the breach thereof, which cannot be settled by mediation
as described above, then the parties agree to submit to non-binding
arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under
its Non-Binding Arbitration Rules before the parties may initiate
binding arbitration, litigation, or some other type of dispute
resolution process.


### 5.6. Recovery

In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable
attorney’s fees and expenses.


### 5.7. Integrity

If any provision of this Agreement, or restriction of this Agreement,
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, or
unenforceable, or void, such provision will be modified, rewritten or
interpreted to include as much of its nature and scope as will render
it enforceable. If it cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted
to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, and the
remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision was
not included.

Any failure by either party to enforce the other party’s strict
performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a
waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any
other provision of this Agreement.


### 5.8. Remedies

Both parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information to be
disclosed hereunder is of a unique and valuable character, and that
the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would
destroy or diminish the value of such information. The damages to
Disclosing Party that would result from the unauthorized dissemination
of the Confidential Information would be impossible to calculate.

Therefore, both parties hereby agree that the Disclosing Party shall
be entitled to injunctive relief preventing the dissemination of any
Confidential Information in violation of the terms hereof. Such
injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other remedies available
hereunder, whether at law or in equity. Disclosing Party shall be
entitled to recover its costs and fees, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees, incurred in obtaining any such relief.

only be modified by a written amendment signed by the party against
whom enforcement of such modification is sought.
